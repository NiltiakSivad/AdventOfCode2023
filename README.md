# Advent Of Code 2023

## About

This is a play project to reaquaint me, Kaitlin, with Swift and iOS after a multi-year hiatus. There is no other purpose. I just make up things that feel fun and hope I learn something from it.

I keep a separate JOURNAL markdown file to capture my ðŸ¦„ðŸŒˆ imaginative thought process and plan for each day.
